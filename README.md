## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I am getting familiar with fetching external API data. I also learned how to do better css styling especially for media queries. During my project 1, I was so confused and behind all the materials I learned. So, I could not really decorate my website and add helpful and creative features. But, I am glad I am getting used to javascript more than before and now have courage to attempt some advanced skills.


### Weaknesses: While I learned a lot about CSS styling, I also realize I still need more practices with it. I am also still struggling with makinng comment section, especially the place where comments are posted. I was searching how to make delete function and found there are several ways to do it, but most were written in component function, which I am not familiar with and not familiar to convert it to regular function. So, I realize that I need to be more familiar with how to write component function and how to convert it to regular javascript function way.

### Opportunities: This project gave me an opportunity to apply all the knowledge and skills learned throughout the Unit 2. In addition, I had great opportunities to practice materials learned from Unit 1.

### Threats: Overall, I still need a lot of practices. I will not be able to create a usable website without referring to the sample codes that instructors provided. I know I do not need to memorize everything, but I still need to get familiar with all those materials I learned so that I can freely and confidently use them or debug.
