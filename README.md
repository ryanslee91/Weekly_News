### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- UTILIZING REACT COMPONENTS PROPERLY.
- USE AXIOS TO CONSUME DATA FROM AIRTABLE, AND RENDER THAT DATA IN MY COMPONENTS.
- USE AXIOS TO POST NEW DATA ON AIRTABLE


#### PostMVP  
- CREATE A 2ND HEADER THAT DISPLAYS MAJOR STOCK OR CURRENCY INFO
like the one in Wallstreetjournal.
- MAKE 'KOREAN' VERSION AVAILABLE.
