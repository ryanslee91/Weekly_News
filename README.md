### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- UTILIZING REACT COMPONENTS PROPERLY.
- USE AXIOS TO CONSUME DATA FROM AIRTABLE, AND RENDER THAT DATA IN MY COMPONENTS.
- USE AXIOS TO POST NEW DATA ON AIRTABLE


#### PostMVP  
- CREATE A 2ND HEADER THAT DISPLAYS MAJOR STOCK OR CURRENCY INFO
like the one in Wallstreetjournal.
- MAKE 'KOREAN' VERSION AVAILABLE.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
